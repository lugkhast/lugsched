What is forever-alone?
-----------------------------
Forever-Alone is a web app for finding common courses and free time among you
and your friends.

It aims to be a more useful replacement for the deluge of screenshots of
spreadsheets with schedule info that gets posted to Facebook/Google+ every
time a new term begins.


forever-alone is currently...
-----------------------------

 * being rewritten from the ground up, to be independent of Google App Engine

This is being done as we are not comfortable with the potential lock-in that
we would experience should we continue in the original, App Engine-hosted
web app. The rewrite is expected to go far quicker than the initial development,
as the problems have already been discovered and sorted out before.

Credit where credit is due
--------------------------

"Forever Alone" (no, not this app) is an Internet meme. See 
[this Know Your Meme page][kymfa]. The name was chosen due to its contrast
between the very social-oriented goal of this app, and the antisocial, lonely
nature of the Forever Alone meme.
