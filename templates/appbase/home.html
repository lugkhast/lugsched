LugSched: College schedules done right

        <h1>College is fun. Being by yourself isn't.</h1>
        <p>
            Are the schedules of you and your friends drifting away from each other, with your courses no longer matching up,
            but you still want to meet up often and do something fun? <b>That's what LugSched is for.</b>
        </p>
        <h1 class="clear">Sharing is caring!</h1>
        <p>
            Create your schedule, share them with your friends, and let LugSched figure out when you <i>won't</i>
            be forever alone. It's that simple!
        </p>
        <h1>And all you need is a Google Account! <sup>(and, umm, friends...)<sup></h1>
        <p>
            What are you waiting for? Log in and get started!
