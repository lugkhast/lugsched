Below are very important things to do before deploying the app to 
EC2/Linode/wherever I decide to put it:

 * Do a grep for "DEPLOY-NOTE". If you actually manage to forget how to do
   so, here's what you should type:

       grep "DEPLOY-NOTE" -r *

    Make sure to do everything that comes up there.

    Take note that the things that DEPLOY-NOTEs ask for should NOT go into
    the Git repository. Otherwise, it would simply go into the repo and
    wouldn't require extra deployment hassle.

(add stuff here as needed)
